# Alexander Forsell

Unreal Engine 5 gameplay programmer focused on building core gameplay systems.

This repository serves as a living portfolio and development log, showcasing work-in-progress systems such as weapons, AI, and dynamic world generation. Each section documents what is implemented, what is planned, known issues, and areas marked for refactoring or improvement.

All projects shown here are actively developed and intentionally presented as snapshots of the iteration process rather than finished products.
